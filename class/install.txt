Introduction

These are the class files that run the Moopig sound generator.
They have been compiled from the source code and are provided as a convenience.
The compilation was done using IntelliJ as a HappyBrackets project if you want to use the original source.

They are designed to run under the HappyBrackets environment.

These classes have been tested on a Raspberry Pi.

Install:
  Create the path if it doesn't already exist
  /home/pi/HappyBrackets/data/classes/net/happybrackets/peter
  and copy the class files there.


Configure:
  Set HappyBrackets to auto run by editing the startup script. 
  nano ~/HappyBrackets/scripts/run.sh

  and set the ACTION line as follows

  ACTION=net.happybrackets.peter.moopig

Troubleshoot:

  If there is no sound then check that the audio is set to go to the port that you want, 3.5mm jack or HDMI.

  If Moopig doesn't work, restart the server to see if there are any errors.


  cd ~/HappyBrackets

  sudo killall java

  sudo ./scripts/run.sh
